     <li>Use quotation marks to search as a phrase.

     <li>Use "+" before a term to make it required. (Otherwise results matching only some of your terms may be included).</li>

     <li>Use "-" before a word or phrase to exclude.

     <li>Use "OR", "AND", and "NOT" to create complex boolean logic. You can use parentheses in your complex expressions. </li>

     <li>Truncation and wildcards are not supported - word-stemming is done automatically.</li>
